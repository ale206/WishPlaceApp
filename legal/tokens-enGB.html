        <h1>Wishplace – Tokens / Credits Policy</h1>
        
        <div class="metadata">
            <p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.0</p>
            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19 December 2025</p>
        </div>

        <p>This Tokens / Credits Policy ("Policy") explains the acquisition, management, and usage of digital tokens ("Tokens" or "Credits") within the Wishplace platform (the "Platform"). This Policy forms an integral part of the Wishplace Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <h2>1. Purpose of This Policy</h2>
        <p>Wishplace uses a token-based system to provide users with flexible access to premium features, property listings, and visibility enhancements. This document outlines your rights and responsibilities regarding these digital units.</p>

        <h2>2. Legal Status of Tokens</h2>
        <p>Tokens are digital consumable units purchased exclusively through the Platform.</p>
        <p>By purchasing or using Tokens, you acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They have no monetary value and are not legal tender.</li>
            <li>They are not transferable between accounts or users.</li>
            <li>They cannot be exchanged for cash, real-world currency, or services outside the Platform.</li>
            <li>They represent a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to access specific features within Wishplace.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Acquisition of Tokens</h2>
        <p>Tokens can only be obtained through authorized channels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> Handled exclusively via the Apple App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).</li>
            <li><strong>Wishplace Role:</strong> Wishplace does not process payments directly. All billing, currency conversion, and payment security are managed by the respective App Store providers.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotional Tokens:</strong> Wishplace may, at its sole discretion, award "Bonus" or "Promotional" tokens. These carry the same restrictions as purchased tokens but may be subject to specific expiration dates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Usage and Consumption</h2>
        <p>Tokens are "consumed" when used to perform specific actions. Current uses include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating "Wish Places" or publishing properties.</li>
            <li>Unlocking premium visibility or contact features.</li>
            <li>Accessing experimental or beta features.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The required number of Tokens for any action will be clearly displayed before you confirm the transaction. Once an action is confirmed, the Tokens are immediately deducted from your balance and considered "used."</p>

        <h2>5. Management and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Token balances are stored and managed via Firebase (Google Cloud) services.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Your balance is strictly tied to your Firebase UID (linked to your Apple, Google, or Email login).</li>
            <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the security of your authentication provider. If you lose access to your Apple or Google account, Wishplace may be unable to recover your token balance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Refunds and Forfeiture</h2>
        <p>Except where required by local law (such as EU consumer rights where applicable):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Used Tokens:</strong> Non-refundable once the digital service has been rendered.</li>
            <li><strong>Unused Tokens:</strong> Non-refundable by Wishplace.</li>
            <li><strong>App Store Decisions:</strong> Because payments are handled by Apple or Google, all refund requests must be submitted through their respective platforms. Wishplace cannot manually override a refund denial from an App Store.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> If you choose to delete your account, any remaining balance is permanently forfeited and will not be reimbursed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Expiration</h2>
        <p>Purchased Tokens do not currently have an expiration date, provided your account remains active. However, Wishplace reserves the right to implement an expiration policy for inactive accounts (e.g., accounts with no login for 24+ months), subject to providing 30 days' notice via the registered email address.</p>

        <h2>8. Account Integrity and Abuse</h2>
        <p>Wishplace reserves the right to suspend access or reset token balances without compensation in cases of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fraud or Chargebacks:</strong> Any reversed payment via the App Store will result in the immediate removal of the corresponding Tokens and potential account suspension.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Abuse:</strong> Violations of the Terms and Conditions or attempts to "farm" or manipulate the token system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Technical Dependencies & Service Levels</h2>
        <p>Wishplace relies on Google Cloud and Firebase for real-time ledger management. While we strive for 100% uptime, Wishplace is not liable for temporary inability to access or use Tokens due to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Third-party infrastructure outages (Google Cloud, Apple, or Google Play services).</li>
            <li>Localized internet connectivity issues.</li>
            <li>Scheduled maintenance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Data & Analytics</h2>
        <p>To improve the Platform, we use Google Analytics for Firebase to track token usage patterns. This data is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used to optimize feature pricing and flow.</li>
            <li>Aggregated and pseudonymized.</li>
            <li>Handled in accordance with our <a href="privacy-enGB.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our features or legal requirements. Material changes will be signaled via an in-app notification. Your continued use of the Platform after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>This Policy is governed by the laws of Spain. Any disputes arising from the use of Tokens shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Spain.</p>
