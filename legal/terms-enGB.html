        <h1>Wishplace – Terms and Conditions</h1>
        
        <div class="metadata">
            <p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.0</p>
            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19 December 2025</p>
        </div>

        <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you") and Alessio Di Salvo, acting as an individual (natural person) ("Operator", "we", "us"), regarding your use of the Wishplace mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Platform").</p>

        <p>By accessing or using Wishplace, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately cease use of the Platform.</p>

        <h2>1. Nature of the Service</h2>
        <p>Wishplace is a technical platform-only service. It acts as a digital venue to facilitate information exchange between users interested in real estate.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wish Places:</strong> Users may publish "wishes" (requirements for residential, commercial, or parking spaces) for specific addresses or areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Property Listings:</strong> Users may publish properties they own for the purpose of renting or selling.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Matching:</strong> The Platform uses an algorithm to connect "Wish Places" with relevant "Property Listings" based on user-defined criteria (e.g., size, price, rooms).</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Interaction:</strong> The Platform allows property owners to initiate chats with interested users.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="disclaimer">
            <strong>CRITICAL DISCLAIMERS:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>NO BROKERAGE:</strong> WISHPLACE IS NOT A REAL ESTATE BROKER, AGENT, OR MEDIATOR.</li>
                <li><strong>NO VERIFICATION:</strong> WE DO NOT VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF USER-PROVIDED DATA (e.g., number of rooms, toilets, square meters, or legal ownership).</li>
                <li><strong>ALGORITHMIC LIMITATIONS:</strong> Matches are generated automatically. We do not guarantee that the algorithm will find a match or that matches will be 100% accurate to your needs.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> You must be at least 18 years of age.</li>
            <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Registration is required to use the Platform. By registering via Email, Google, or Apple, you agree to the version of the Terms active at the time of sign-up.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You may delete your account and all associated data at any time through the App settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Service Mechanics (Wish Places & Properties)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expiry:</strong> All "Wish Places" and "Property Listings" have a set expiration period. Once expired, they will no longer appear in match results unless renewed.</li>
            <li><strong>User Settings:</strong> Users are responsible for configuring their profiles and requirements (Residential, Commercial, Parking settings). These settings are used by the algorithm to facilitate matches.</li>
            <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> You acknowledge that by listing a property or a "Wish Place," certain data (price range, preferences, etc.) will be visible to potential matches.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Content and Conduct</h2>
        <p>"User Content" includes profile pictures, names, bios, property descriptions, and requirement settings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warranties:</strong> You warrant that all information provided is accurate and that you have the right to post the addresses and properties you list.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting & Blocking:</strong> We provide a report button in the chat and on listings. Reporting a user for Spam, Inappropriate Content, Harassment, Fake Listings, or Fraudulent Behavior will immediately block your ability to communicate with that user and trigger a moderation review.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Communication and Conduct</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct Chat:</strong> Only property owners may initiate a chat with an interested user.</li>
            <li><strong>Conduct:</strong> Users must maintain a respectful tone. Phishing, spamming, or sharing sensitive financial data in the chat is strictly prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> The Operator does not monitor private chats in real-time but may review chats that have been reported by a user for safety and compliance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Tokens, Credits, and Payments</h2>
        <p>The Platform operates on a "Credit" system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consumption:</strong> Credits are consumed for specific actions, including but not limited to: adding an address, renewing an expired address, or initiating a contact/chat with a user.</li>
            <li><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> Credits are topped up via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. These transactions are subject to the respective store's terms.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cash Value:</strong> Credits are digital consumables with no monetary value and are non-refundable, except where required by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Free Credits:</strong> Credits provided for free upon registration are promotional and may be revoked if we suspect fraudulent account creation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Notifications</h2>
        <p>By using the Platform, you consent to receive Push Notifications related to matches, chat messages, and account updates. You can manage notification preferences in your device settings.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interactions:</strong> We are not liable for the outcome of any meetings, viewings, or financial transactions between users.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Loss:</strong> We are not liable for the loss of any User Content or settings due to technical issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Liability Cap:</strong> Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for Credits in the 12 months preceding the claim.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Modification and Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or block users (via Firebase or other technical means) who violate these Terms. We may modify these Terms at any time, and your continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated version.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Spain. Any disputes shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Spain.</p>
